# PCOS Detection using Machine Learning 🧬🩺

This project focuses on early detection of **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)** using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict the presence of PCOS based on various medical and personal features collected from patients.

## 📌 Features

- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models
- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Visualizations for better understanding of patterns
- User-friendly Jupyter Notebook environment

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation includes medical parameters that are relevant to PCOS diagnosis. Features include hormonal levels, BMI, follicle count, and other clinical parameters.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
